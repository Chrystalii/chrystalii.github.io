  The first to propose an unbiased and semantic-aware disentanglement learning called CaDSI (Causal Disentanglement for Semantics-Aware Intent Learning) from a causal perspective. Particularly, CaDSI explicitly models the causal relations underlying recommendation task, and thus produces semantic-aware representations via disentangling usersâ€™ true intents aware of specific item context.
