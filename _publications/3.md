abstract: >-
  Little research has been done to reveal how the ratings are missing (Missing-Not-At-Random problem) from a causal perspective. To bridge the gap, we propose an unbiased and robust method called DENC (De-Bias Network Confounding in Recommendation), inspired by confounder analysis in causal inference.
